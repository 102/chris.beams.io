title: Learn Conversational German
---

_Status: Ongoing_

At the time of my writing this in July 2014, I've lived in [Vienna](/places/austria/vienna) off and on over the last four years, and I've been here full-time for the last two.

In that time, I've failed to achieve anything close to conversational fluency in German. I'm not talking about making mistakes and being imperfect; I mean that if it's anything more complex than ordering my food, chances are I won't form the first sentence.

The trouble is that most of the time I can get by on English alone. The majority of Viennese speak it well, and what's worse, when I do try to speak German, many hear my accent or notice my mistakes and respond in English even without my asking. (I felt insulted by that for a while, but then realized that they probably have no idea how frustrating it is for me.)

Over the years, I've tried a number of different ways to learn, including:

 - [Pimsleur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimsleur_language_learning_system) audio lessons
 - Private tutoring at home
 - Group lessons at [local language schools](http://www.alpha.at)
 - Private sessions at the world-famous [Berlitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlitz_Corporation) school
 - Reading and translating newspapers and books
 - Studying vocab and grammar books
 - Memorization through [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) with [Anki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software))
 - Gamified learning with [Duolingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo)

To be sure, I've learned a lot about German in this process, and today I can understand at least some of what I hear and even more of what I read. However, this is of little consolation. What matters to me is being able to participate in social situations and daily life without forcing people to speak my language, and I'm not there yet.

For all the efforts above, the one thing I haven't done is perhaps the most obvious: _just speak German every chance I get_ (including insisting on it when folks switch to English). Grammar and vocab are of obvious importance, but I've come to understand the hard way that all the studying in the world amounts to nothing if one doesn't practice.

So with this project, I'm renewing my effort to learn German, but this time with a focus on conversation, and with the specific goal of being [certified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe-Institut#Exams) at [level B2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels), at which point the learner can (**emphasis** mine):

 > - understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation

 > - **interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party**

 > - produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options

It's worth noting that I've never set such a goal before. It's always been a more general intention to simply "learn German". In hindsight, it's not too surprising that this hasn't worked out well.

As for focusing on conversation, I've recently discovered [italki.com](http://italki.com), a marketplace for matching language instructors and students. All lessons are held online, via Skype or similar. I've had an introductory session with an instructor already, and plan to use this platform to get as much "conversation exercise" as possible. I'll work with my instructors there to get a sense of how far away I am from achieving my goal of B2-level fluency, and I'll post progress updates here in [writing](/writing).
