_Status: Ongoing_

In May 2014, I left my position with the [Spring](http://spring.io) team to dedicate my time to independent research and develop my writing skills. This site was created to support both of these efforts.

When I say "independent research", I don't mean anything formal. I simply mean that I've become fascinated with certain things, and I want to spend as much time as I can understanding them in the hope that I can produce new ideas and add value.

One of things I've become fascinated by is Bitcoin. While this technology is still young, I believe virtual currency can and will revolutionize the way the world thinks about and uses money. So, I've been getting to know the Bitcoin development community, attending conferences and meetups, and dreaming up a few project ideas of my own.

Along the way, I've been sharpening my sense of what's important for the future of the internet. I've been exposed to inspiring thinking on the topic of our freedom in the digital world and beyond, and I've come to appreciate deeply why free software, decentralization and peer-to-peer technologies are so important.

Altogether, there is a great opportunity before us as technologists to redesign a future internet in which users own their data and communicate and transact with the privacy all people deserve, but making it happen won't be easy. The bar of convenience—as set by today's "free" internet services and closed software providers—is very high indeed, and to leap over it, we'll need not only bright ideas and great tech; we'll need new business models and clever marketing too. The good news is that we're not alone. As I write this, many others are thinking and doing the same. It is an interesting time to be alive and writing code.

I don't know how long this research period will last; probably until I come upon an idea or project so interesting that I feel I must devote myself to it completely. In the meantime, I'll share my thoughts about what I encounter here—because for me, [writing](/writing) is the best way to think clearly and that means it's a great way to determine what's worth spending my time on.
