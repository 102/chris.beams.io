I was born in Great Falls, Montana on July 2nd, 1978 at 7:02 AM, and I began writing this post in Vienna, Austria on July 11th, 2014 at 1:32 PM. Because the latter occurred 18,947,431 minutes after the former, this post can also be accessed at [chris.beams.io/18947431]({{ site.url }}/18947431). Go ahead, click itâ€”you'll be redirected back here.

Back? Great. So what's this all about?

What if we thought of our birthdate not in terms of a calendar date, but as our "zero-moment", our own personal _epoch_? If our birthdate represents 0 on on our personal timeline, then we can then timestamp any later event in our lives in terms of the amount of time that has elapsed since that moment.

Combine that simple number with a personal domain name, and you have a URL scheme that can accommodate recording anything and everything you've ever done or experienced.



The reason started out 

We all have a birthday, and besides serving as an annual excuse to party, we don't use it for much. 

In fact, every page on this site is available in timestamped form.

When putting this site together, I thought it would be a good idea to give every page a shortlink-friendly numerical ID that redirects to a human-readable URL. For example, http://chris.beams.io/1234 might redirect to http://chris.beams.io/notes/some-long-post-title.

This is of course not a new idea, and has been implemented many times by various blogging platforms and content management systems. However, this is a simple, statically-generated site without the benefit (or burden) of a database to keep track of and assign new IDs. So I wondered: what's the best way to implement such a scheme?

This is good for passing around shortlinks. For example, the page you're looking at now
