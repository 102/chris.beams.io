<!--
Books I have read, in part or in whole, listed in descending order of those most
recently read. Duplicate entries indicate re-reading the book.

Images should have 300px height, width may vary. Use the `cover.sh` command in
this directory to retrieve, resize and rename the image appropriately:

    ./cover.sh https://example.com/foo.jpg foo.jpg

Images should be optimized for size to around 16-20K. The conversion tool above
also performs this optimization, otherwise use jpegoptim.
