It took a bit of doing, but I've pretty much emulated GH Pages publish-on-push behavior. The [serve.sh](https://github.com/cbeams/chris.beams.io/blob/master/serve.sh) script is kicked off as an OS X launch daemon at boot, fetches new changes when pinged by a GitHub webhook, and can survive force pushes / rebases.
