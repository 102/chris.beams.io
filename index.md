Greetings! I'm an independent software developer and US expat living in Vienna. I helped build [Spring](http://spring.io), and am now focused on Bitcoin-related technology. I'm `cbeams` on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cbeams), [GitHub](http://github.com/cbeams) and [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net), and you can email me at [{{ site.author.email }}](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}). My [PGP](http://www.bitcoinnotbombs.com/beginners-guide-to-pgp/) key is [here](/pgp.txt).

I enjoy giving [talks](/talks) on technical topics and occasionally [write](/writing). To find out more about me and what I'm up to, visit the [about](/about) and [projects](/projects) pages.
