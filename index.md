This is the website of Chris Beams. I'm a software developer focused on Bitcoin, privacy and individual freedom. I'm best known for my work on the [Spring](https://spring.io) Java application development framework and the [Bisq](https://bisq.network) peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange network. I also wrote a widely-referenced article on [how to write a Git commit message](/posts/git-commit). I enjoy delivering technical [talks](/talks) and have been a guest on a number of Bitcoin-related [podcasts](/media). You can get in touch with me via the contact links on this page.
