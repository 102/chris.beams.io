<!--
Books I have read, in part or in whole, listed in descending order of those most
recently read. Duplicate entries indicate re-reading the book.

Images should have 300px height, width may vary. Use ImageMagick command
line tools to resize, e.g.:

    convert img.jpg -resize x300 img.jpg

Images should be optimized for size to around 16-20K. The conversion tool above
also performs this optimization, otherwise use jpegoptim.
