_I'm working on a longer piece on this topic, but [a self-imposed deadline](/posts/practice) demands that I get something published now. Here is a brief summary of things I'll go into more detail on later._

Two days ago, the US Consumer Finance Protection Beareau (CFPB) [released](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/consumer-advisory-virtual-currencies-and-what-you-should-know-about-them/) a [six-page document](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201408_cfpb_consumer-advisory_virtual-currencies.pdf) advising consumers on "risks posed by virtual currencies". While generally negative (it is about _risks_ after all), it is thoughtfully written and without major errors or misinformation. It clearly has educating consumers in mind, and for that I'm glad to see it.

Reading the document and thinking about the audience of new users it addresses, I was reminded of a concern I've had for a while now.

As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, it becomes more likely that newcomers will take a look at the landscape and decide that storing their bitcoin in "web wallets" is the normal thing to do. This is predictable because it's the web wallet companies that will do the lion's share of advertising to this demographic.

New users will ask around, choose one provider or another, store all their bitcoin there and be done with it. It'll feel like PayPal++ for them (and indeed, once PayPal itself supports bitcoin, users will probably just stay there). For reasons I'll go into below, this is not a good thing.

The major web wallets like [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com), [Blockchain](http://blockchain.info) and [Circle](http://circle.com) are serious companies. They're heavily invested in security (in the case of the latter, your funds are even insured against theft). They all have interesting features. I have accounts with each of them. I have nothing against the existence of these sites _per se_.

With that said, I keep very low balances with them, if any at all. I almost never transact through them. In most cases, I will set up an account with a new provider out of curiosity just to get a first-hand look at what's on offer. Afterwards, I leave it alone.

The reasons for this are several:

**Private keys are called private for a reason.** Why would I ever give another entity control over my money if I didn't have to? Securing one's own bitcoin wallet (read: securing one's own private keys) certainly means educating oneself and taking proper precautions, but isn't it worth it? For the first time in history, we have complete financial autonomy at our fingertips. Don't give it up for a few conveniences. Stay strong; stay decentralized. The features will still come.

**Strength in numbers.** The strength of the bitcoin network is in the number of its peers—especially as regards the number of [full nodes on the network](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/) that perform transaction validation. Centralizing wallets and transactions through several companies is the opposite of the way bitcoin was designed to work. We've seen this movie before: email has become the domain of a few major providers. Very few people would even consider running their own email servers (and increasingly, fewer companies do). Properly managing your own bitcoin wallet is far easier than managing most email servers. Keep the network diverse and distributed; bitcoin's health depends on it.

**Privacy in general.** Have we learned nothing in recent years? Centralized organizations—be they banks, search giants, or indeed bitcoin web wallets and exchanges—have a fatal inherent flaw: they can be controlled, manipulated, hacked, corrupted. Your data is not your own with these organizations. Read the terms and conditions. Bitcoin presents users with a radical proposition in regard to money: that the only terms and conditions you need adhere to are (a) those inherent in the the math that powers bitcoin and (b) your own. Why would I choose to be subject to rules not in my favor if I didn't have to?

I realize that these opinions are those of someone privileged with the technical capacity, time, and enthusiasm to act on them. This only means that there is much work to be done in making proper bitcoin use more accessible to the masses. The answer is not to consolidate everything through a few convenient websites.
