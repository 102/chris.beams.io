_In [this piece][1] for the Financial Times, Shane Harris describes how the US's aborted Total Information Awareness program inspired modern-day Singapore's surveillance state._

Prior to reading this I had a vague awareness that Singapore is heavy on surveillance, but no idea the breadth of its scope and surprising level of acceptance by Singaporeans. I appreciate Harris's constraint and balance here; what looks like an obvious and infuriating intrusion on privacy turns out to be much more nuanced and pernicious. What happens when a state uses surveillance data not just to persecute, but to placate its people? What happens when big data is used to manufacture consent for gathering ever greater amounts of it?

It seems that Singapore is a laboratory indeed, all the more able to experiment for its small size. Let's hope they discover a path to continued security and prosperity without the continued sacrifice of personal privacy and freedom.
