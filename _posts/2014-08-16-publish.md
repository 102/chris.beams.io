_One of the best things about hosting a site with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is "publication on push". What follows is a simple way to achieve the same results when hosting your site at home._

I wrote earlier about [why I host at home](/posts/indiehost). If you're using Jekyll and would like to do the same, [serve.sh](https://github.com/cbeams/chris.beams.io/blob/master/serve.sh) is a helpful script you might want to crib from.

It listens for requests from a [GitHub webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/) that fires when I push commits into [this site's repository](https://github.com/cbeams/chris.beams.io). The script accepts the request, git pulls the latest changes, kills the currently running jekyll and restarts it. The script then loops and listens once again for the next webhook request.

Note that I opted for killing and restarting jekyll to avoid the polling overhead of `jekyll --watch`. I've also noticed that `--watch` can sometimes get caught in a loop and constantly regenerate pages, causing CPU to spike.

Here's a copy of the script for quick reference. See [serve.sh on master](https://github.com/cbeams/chris.beams.io/blob/master/serve.sh) for the latest changes.

```sh
$ cat serve.sh
#!/bin/bash

HOOKPORT=12345
SERVEPORT=4000

cd $(dirname $0)

echo updating git repo...
/usr/local/bin/git stash # just to be safe
/usr/local/bin/git fetch origin
/usr/local/bin/git reset --hard origin/master

while true; do
    echo starting jekyll on port $SERVEPORT...
    jekyll serve --port $SERVEPORT &
    JEKYLLPID=$!
    echo jekyll started with pid $JEKYLLPID.
    echo listening for webhook notifications on port $HOOKPORT.
    echo -e "HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n" | nc -l $HOOKPORT
    echo got webhook request. updating git repo...
    /usr/local/bin/git stash # just to be safe
    /usr/local/bin/git fetch origin
    /usr/local/bin/git reset --hard origin/master
    echo git repo updated. killing jekyll.
    kill -9 $JEKYLLPID
done

```

It's simple, but not quite secure. It should be checking the value of the `X-Hub-Signature` header [sent by the GitHub webhook request](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#delivery-headers), whose value is a digest of the request payload using a secret configured on the GitHub side as the key. Requests that do not have a valid `X-Hub-Signature` value should be rejected to avoid an attack that would cause the script to loop without blocking, constantly killing and restarting jekyll.

Perhaps posting this will shame me into fixing that. In the meantime, if you have a quick way to do it in bash, pull requests welcome.
