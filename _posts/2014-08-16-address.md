_It's common today to see bitcoin "tip addresses", but they're terrible for privacy. Here's a simple idea how the situation might be improved._

Perhaps you've seen this sort of thing before:

This particular bitcoin address belongs to author Sandy Ressler, as advertised on each of [his articles at Bitcoin Magazine](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/author/sandy-ressler/).

Bitcoin tip addresses like this are great; they allow anyone who likes your stuff—whatever it is you do—to chip in a few cents here and there in appreciation. Nice, right?

There's just one problem: they're terrible for privacy. It's trivially easy with a blockchain explorer to see that this address has recieved a total of 1.2108 bitcoins at the time of this writing.

As you can see, those coins are now tied directly to Sandy. Worse, with further analysis this information can be used to de-anonymize additional transactions that Sandy has participated in, especially regarding any coins that get spent from that address.

For these reasons, it's well-understood in the bitcoin community that addresses shouldn't be re-used at all. And yet folks still do it in cases like this, because there aren't really any alternatives. I'm sure Sandy is aware of the issues, but like many others just taking a calculated risk.

There must be a better way.

What if, instead of publishing a single, reusable bitcoin address, we published a _personal bitcoin address url_ that returns a fresh address on each request?

Something like this:

    # first request...
    $ curl https://chris.beams.io/bitcoin
    { "address" : "162D1SzgDG3KQhqiRCDoJQTtb78PPmBjFS" }

    # second request...
    $ curl https://chris.beams.io/bitcoin
    { "address" : "1NiZz6zqRjcu5PBgqa7ZtpuEiUiepFVYMb" }

    # and so on...

The above is just a quick sketch. Perhaps the idea is so full of holes that it's not worth further consideration. Perhaps it's already been done and I've missed it. Or perhaps not, and I'll begin putting something like this together.

In no particular order, here are a few of the thoughts, considerations, and constraints I've come up with so far. I'd appreciate feedback in the comments.

1. HTTPS would be critical for any such service to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks and other surveillance.

2. The [Payment Protocol](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=300809.0) specification is out there, but by my reading it is designed to address more sophisticated use cases. What's needed for privacy-friendly tipping is something dead simple.

3. Tipping widgets like [CoinWidget](http://coinwidget.com/) could provide support for this approach. Picture a "Tip" button that simply makes the JSON request in the background and presents the user with a new address. (Though [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing) considerations might make this unworkable).

4. For security, addresses should be generated from a deterministic wallet in order to avoid the need to expose private keys on the webserver issuing the new addresses. As it turns out, this very use case is anticipated in [BIP 32's Motivation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#motivation) section:
> [E]lliptic curve mathematics permit schemes where one can calculate the public keys without revealing the private keys. This permits for example a webshop business to let its webserver generate fresh addresses (public key hashes) for each order or for each customer, without giving the webserver access to the corresponding private keys (which are required for spending the received funds).

5. Precautions should be taken to avoid DoS-style attacks aimed at exhausting available addresses (although the number of such addresses that can be created from a master seed is a number so large as not to be much of a concern in practice).

6. Users who wish to tip anonymously will have concerns about their IP address potentially being logged in association with each newly created bitcoin address. Tor or similar would be important for these users.

7. [Keybase](https://keybase.io) (which I wrote about [a couple days ago](http://chris.beams.io/posts/keybase)) has the interesting feature of associating a bitcoin address with your profile. For example:<br><br>
<a href="https://keybase.io/cbeams">![My keybase profile](http://i.imgur.com/PoGXIHV.png)</a>
The idea behind this feature is that someday a Keybase-aware app will let users do something like the following:
<blockquote>
Send 0.2 BTC to Twitter user @cbeams
</blockquote>
This would be huge, because it would finally abstract folks away from ugly Bitcoin addresses, and allow them to think of payment in more human terms. It would be possible to write that app today using Keybase's API (I think), but the problem is that you'd be stuck re-using the same single address for each payment. If Keybase were to embrace this bitcoin address URL idea, it could lead to the creation of truly privacy-friendly abstraction layers over bitcoin addresses.

8. The JSON response from calls to a bitcoin address service could also include a signature of the address, signed using the owner's public key. This would allow client applications to verify that they are indeed sending money to an address owned by the correct recipient. Again, this is a place that Keybase's new approach to PKI could come in really handy.

Note that none of this is really limited to tipping, per se. Personal bitcoin address services like the one described above would be useful for facilitating any person-to-person payment in a privacy-friendly way.
