_Sam Harris has posted the first chapter of his new book. It does not disappoint._

Harris is one of my favorite authors. Among the many reasons I appreciate his work is his fearlessness in embracing and exploring spiritual experience while remaining steadfastly skeptical and scientific.

His new book, [_Waking Up_][1], is dedicated to doing away with the false dichotomy between these domains. Though the full text won't be available until next month, reading the [first chapter][2] today was already sufficient cause for writing this post.

As he has done so well before in shorter essays, Harris writes about his experience with psychedelic drugs in his youth and the profoundly positive effect they had on his conception of himself and capacity for loving others. He goes on to share how meditation has become a way of accessing similar states of mind on a regular basis. Indeed, a primary goal of the book is to help readers learn a simple and effective way to meditate, that they might experience the same benefits.

It means a lot to me to see a writer with Harris's skill take these topics seriously, because both psychedelics and meditation have played important roles in my own life. That's not information I often share with people—much less with the whole web—but my encounter today with _Waking Up_ reminds me that _speaking up_ is one of the most powerful things we can do to change minds. If enough of us do, perhaps a day will come when the exploration of one's own mind won't require such discretion—or carry with it the insane penalty of imprisonment.

If you have experience with psychedelics, then reading Harris on this topic will make your day. If on the other hand you find yourself in mild shock at the very sight of the acronymn LSD, then reading Harris is an absolute must. Either the [first chapter of _Waking Up_][2] or his earlier essay [_Drugs and the Meaning of Life_][3] will do nicely. Should you find yourself fascinated and wanting to learn more, I recommend reading Albert Hoffman's [_LSD: My Problem Child_][4] and Aldous Huxley's [_The Doors of Perception_][5].

If you're experienced with meditation, you may find Harris's approach invigorating for your own practice, or perhaps inspiring you to start sitting again after a hiatus. If you're unfamiliar and already wincing at thoughts of your local new-age bookstore, don't worry. Meditation has nothing to do with believing things on bad evidence or being reverential toward anyone or anything. It is nothing more than the practiced observation of your own mind—perhaps the supreme example of that which is simple but not easy.

Psychedelics will take you to extraordinary states of mind as surely as if you were strapped to a rocket. Meditation can guide you to the same at a more pedestrian pace. Here's hoping that Harris continues to light the fuse and the path to each.
