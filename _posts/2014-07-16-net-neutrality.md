_I just submitted the following comment at [battleforthenet.com](http://www.battleforthenet.com). You should go write something too. And don't miss the John Oliver [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU)._

> What follows is a form letter. However, as a career software engineer of more than 15 years, I endorse every word of it. We count on our government to protect critical common infrastructure, and the web and internet at large is among the most important we have. The web has been an unstoppable engine of innovation and wealth over the last 25 years, and it must not be monopolized by the very corporations that it threatens to disrupt.
> 
> I believe very strongly in free markets and free competition. However, for markets to stay free, they do sometimes need a minimal set of ground rules that prevent the most powerful actors from taking them over.
> 
> Net neutrality is that minimum set of ground rules.
> 
> I implore the parties involved in this decision—in the FCC, the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the White House—to consider the greatest good for the greatest number; to understand the facts; to hold public hearings with panels of relevant technology experts from the public and private sectors. I assure you that the balance of evidence is heavily in favor of preserving—and strengthening—net neutrality laws.
> 
> Please do not let the short-term moneyed interests of a few interfere with the long-term economic prosperity of us all.
> 
> Thank you.

> 
> Net neutrality is the First Amendment of the Internet, the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) treat all data equally. As an Internet user, net neutrality is vitally important to me. The FCC should use its Title II authority to protect it.
> 
> Most Americans have only one choice for truly high speed Internet: their local cable company. This is a political failure, and it is an embarrassment. America deserves competition and choice.
> 
> Without net neutrality, a bad situation gets even worse. These ISPs will now be able to manipulate our Internet experience by speeding up some services and slowing down others. That kills choice, diversity, and quality.
> 
> It also causes tremendous economic harm. If ISPs can speed up favored services and slow others, new businesses will no longer be able to rely on a level playing field. When ISPs can slow your site and destroy your business at will, how can any startup attract investors?
> 
> My friends, family, and I use the Internet for conversation and fun, but also for work and business. When you let ISPs mess with our Internet experience, you are attacking our social lives, our entertainment, and our economic well being. We won't stand for it.
> 
> ISPs are opposing Title II so that they can destroy the FCC's net neutrality rules in court. This is the same trick they pulled last time. Please, let's not be fooled again. Title II is the strong, legally sound way to enforce net neutrality. Use it.
