_I appreciate what Jon Matonis just wrote in response to the CFPB's [recent consumer advisory](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/consumer-advisory-virtual-currencies-and-what-you-should-know-about-them/) on virtual currencies. [Give it a read at CoinDesk](http://www.coindesk.com/cfpb-warning-ignores-bitcoins-consumer-protections/)._

The crux:

> To be fair, the CFPB charter may not include stressing the particular benefits of some payment methods over others. However, when the words ‘financial protection’ are in your agency’s official name, it appears disingenuous to intentionally omit features from what may be one of the world’s most _protective_ financial instruments ever designed.

Matonis then goes on to enumerate a number of bitcoin's inbuilt consumer protections:

> 1. Protection from counterfeit bank notes
> 2. Protection from financial surveillance
> 3. Protection from identity theft
> 4. Protection from physical loss of assets
> 5. Protection from cross-border restrictions and excessive fees
> 6. Protection from payment blockades
> 7. Protection from government-sponsored inflation
> 8. Protection from confiscation

Contrast these benefits against the risks listed in the CFPB's report (which I am paraphrasing here):

1. Virtual currency prices can be very volatile
2. Virtual currency transactions can leak private information
3. You can be hacked (and have your private keys stolen)
4. You are on your own (there is no bank to help you)
5. The government does not insure virtual currencies
6. Virtual currencies aren't legal tender (business aren't forced to take them)

Of course these concerns are all valid and indeed quite important for potential bitcoin users to understand. But unless these risks are presented in the context of bitcoin's extraordinary benefits listed above, they are likely to have more of a frightening effect than an enlightening one.

The question you must ask yourself is this: _Are you willing to deal with these risks in order to realize these benefits?_ Think carefully about that. Think about how much you're currently putting up with in the way that governments and banks deal with your money. It's been this way for so long that it can be easy to miss just how radical the improvement offered by bitcoin is.

A number of the risks listed by the CFPB can be reduced to a single, crucial bit of advice: _don't lose your private keys_. Making that advice easy to follow is tough, but it is possible. It'll happen through continued user education, ever-better designed software wallets, and the proliferation of dedicated hardware wallets, cards, etc.

Price volatility is the other main risk, and it's even harder to tame. In all likelihood we won't see a stable bitcoin value until (a) someone invents a peer-to-peer credit superstructure atop bitcoin and/or (b) it has a great many more users. In either case, velocity will likely be one of the keys to reducing volatility, and there are probably no big shortcuts to getting there.

Fully aware of these risks, I am happily willing to take responsibility for keeping my private keys safe, taking proper precautions with my privacy, and for making sure that I'm not overinvested in a volatile instrument.

I take these calculated risks because I want to see bitcoin's benefits—including its inbuilt consumer protections—realized to the fullest extent for myself and for the largest number of other people. The more people who feel and do the same, the faster we'll get there.
