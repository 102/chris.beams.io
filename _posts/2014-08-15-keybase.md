title: Initial Impressions With Keybase

_I got a [Keybase account](http://keybase.io/cbeams) a couple days ago. Here's a summary of my experience so far, followed by a transcript of setting up my account, establishing my proofs, etc._

The basic idea behind [Keybase](https://keybase.io) is to provide cryptography infrastucture that people can actually use. Think about it like this: what would happen if everyone had a public key? And what if it were easy for everyone else to get that key and know it's the right one?

Among other things, [Johnny might finally learn to encrypt](http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/posters/sheng-poster_abstract.pdf). But it's hard to predict what would happen, really. PGP has been around for so long, and yet so widely ignored; it's hard at first to imagine the situation being otherwise.

Still, this is what Keybase intends to change. Their hope is that by building a modern and friendly platform for public key infrastructure, users and apps of all kinds will come along and take advantage of it.

The onboarding experience goes something like this: create an account, upload your PGP public key, then publish proofs that demonstrate your ownership of that key to your various web properties and social media accounts.

From there, anyone who wants to send you an encrypted message can do so easily and with confidence. For example, to create a message that only I can read, use the `keybase` [command line](https://keybase.io/docs/command_line) to encrypt a message for user [cbeams](https://keybase.com/cbeams):

    $ keybase encrypt -m"Top secret!" cbeams

What just happened?

1. `keybase` looked up user "cbeams" on the server and retrieved my public key and list of published proofs
2. Each proof was checked—client side—to ensure that the public key retrieved is the correct one.
3. `keybase` encrypted the message text (as supplied with -m"Top secret!") using my public key and printed out the result.

Now the message can be copied and sent to me via email, instant messaging, etc. Keybase is agnostic about the method of transmission. So far they haven't provided a built-in way to send messages, and I don't think they should. This is work better done by folks focused on building apps.

Note that the workflow above can be completed without a keybase account. You can do it right now, just by installing the [keybase command line](https://keybase.io/docs/command_line). Go ahead, actually, if you like. It would be fun to get an encrypted message from you. _UPDATE 2014-08-18: Bjørn Pedersen [let me know](https://twitter.com/bepsays/status/500330631931625472) that this isn't working as expected. I've created an issue to track it [here](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/958)._

There's a similar workflow in which you can verify any message that I claim to have digitally signed. For convenience, both encryption and verification workflows can be performed via the Keybase web interface, but it's important to be able to perform these actions—particularly encryption—entirely on the client. For this reason, the `keybase` command will likely remain my preferred tool.

Of course, this is all still pretty low-level stuff. It's far better than [searching MIT's PGP server](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=chris%40beams.io&op=index) for my key—and still not knowing for sure whether it's the right one. But it's nothing that grandma—or even most of your friends—will be using anytime soon. In order for that to happen, web, desktop and mobile apps are going to need to build atop this infrastructure.

Users can also [track](https://keybase.io/docs/tracking) other users. At a glance this looks like a run-of-the mill "follow" button you might find on any social network, but it goes deeper than that. When you track another user, you're indicating your confirmation that they are who they say they are. You're actually signing a snapshot of their identity proofs, and these signed snapshots are then hashed into a [merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) whose root hash is [written into the Bitcoin blockchain](https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/merkle_root_in_bitcoin_blockchain) at regular intervals. This means that the more people track a given user over time, the more and more certain you can be that you're not looking at a freshly corrupted user account.

So far so good. Keybase looks promising, but a couple concerns stand out. 
The first is that the service itself is centralized. The second regards their business model. I asked Chris Coyne, co-founder of Keybase, about both.

With regard to centralization, Coyne said:

> "We've been talking about a total decentralization, but we have to solve a couple things, synchronization in particular. Right now someone can mirror us and a client can trust a mirror just as easily as the server at keybase.io, but there needs to be a way of announcing proofs to any server and having them cooperate with each other. We'd be so happy to get this right."

Fair enough. In any case, "getting decentralization right" should be considered by everyone involved as a requirement for taking Keybase seriously in the long term. I'm glad to hear the founders feel the same way. More information on current mirroring options can be found in the Keybase [server security](https://keybase.io/docs/server_security) docs.

Regarding a business model, Keybase doesn't have one—at least not yet. This has caused understandable concern, especially given than Coyne's previous enterprises (including OkCupid) were acquisition plays.

[Tim McCormack](https://github.com/timmc) asks the question as follows via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/788):

> Before investing time, personal information, and identity into this site, I'd like to have a rough idea of your business model. Is this something you plan to run out of the kindness of your hearts and the money in your wallets, or will it need a funding source at some point?
> 
> Your two previous projects have involved a buyout as exit plan, so you'll understand if I want a little assurance.

And Coyne's response (edited for length):

> [U]nlike SparkNotes or OkCupid [...], Keybase has no clear business model. Previously, we knew exactly what we were doing.

> With Keybase, we're not sure. It's just the two of us right now. [...] It feels like a passion project, and we're driven forward without a lot of concern for where money could come from.
>
> What this means: a clear business model is basically irrelevant because our decision to pursue this is personal.
>
> [...]
>
> As for fears of our doing something unethical to our users, I can only say we're not like that.
>
> Yes, we sold our previous 2 businesses. But I want to point out that (1) neither of those sales ever hurt (and arguably both sales greatly helped) our users, (2) Keybase deserves special consideration which we are aware of, and (3) both Max and I are happy in a world where we never try to sell a company again, and only build things we like.

Almost every sentence of the above indicates that the founders have plenty of cash to fuel continued development and are primarily motivated by concerns other than making more of it. If that's enough for their small team to get the basics right—including decentralization—then it's actually a pretty ideal situation. The most important thing is that Keybase doesn't have hungry VC mouths to feed.

It's hard to imagine any business model at all for Keybase, really. To succeed broadly, this is likely to be the kind of infrastructure that needs to be free. Free in terms of being offered without cost, but just as importantly, free in terms of being licensed under the GPL or something compatible.

It's conceivable that Keybase-the-company could eventually make money by selling enterprise solutions based on Keybase-the-software, and that would be fine. But in the long run, I would want to see see many Keybase servers out there, running and working together without the need to be subsidized by a single company. In what I've gathered from the founders so far, I think they'd agree.

_What follows is a raw transcript of my getting started experience with Keybase, posted here for the benefit of anyone else who's wondering exactly what series of steps to take, and also as feedback for the team at Keybase._

I get the email inviting me to the alpha. There are two options. Click a link or set up from the command line. Thought I'd give the command line a go. I click on the [instructions link](https://keybase.io/docs/command_line/installation), but first wander around the site and [its docs](https://keybase.io/docs) in a bit more detail. Interested to see the new support for [writing signatures into the Bitcoin blockchain](https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/merkle_root_in_bitcoin_blockchain).

Back to installation, the [instructions](https://keybase.io/docs/command_line/installation) offer an `npm`-based and manual installation routes. I already have `npm` installed so I go with that:

    $ npm install -g keybase-installer
    npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/keybase-installer
    npm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/keybase-installer

    Welcome to keybase.io!

    You have successfully installed the command-line client to

    ====>    /usr/local/bin/keybase    <=======

    Please make sure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH.

    If you're new to the service run:

         $ keybase signup        # signup for a new account
         $ keybase push          # to push your public key to the server
             -- or --
         $ keybase gen           # generate a new key and push it

    If you already signed up via the Web or another keybase client, try:

         $ keybase login         # establish a session with the server, and pull down keys

    Once you're configured, you can:

         $ keybase prove twitter # prove your twitter identity
         $ keybase id max        # to identify a friend
         $ keybase track max     # to track them and write a proof to the server

    And then attempt crypto actions like enc/dec/verify/sign.  See `keybase --help` for
    more details.

    $ keybase version

    - libgcrypt 1.5.3
    Identifies as: 'keybase.io node.js client v0.4.15 darwin'

So far so good. What's next? I look around the docs a bit more. I click on [Docs -> Command Line -> Basics](https://keybase.io/docs/command_line).

Looks like `keybase signup` is probably the next thing I should do, using the token provided to me in the signup email. (Again, I could just click the link in the email too, but I want to see what the command line experience is like).

But before I do this, I find myself wondering again about Keybase's features. I Click on the [Docs](https://keybase.io/docs) link once again. What is this business of 'Tracking'? It's explained [here](https://keybase.io/docs/tracking).

Ok. That was a good read. I think I get it. Now I need to try it.

    $ keybase signup
    warn: No config file found; tried '/Users/cbeams/.keybase/config.json'

    info: Success! You are now signed up.

    Welcome to keybase.io! You now need to associate a public key with your
    account.  If you have a key already then:

        keybase push <key-id>  # if you know the ID of the key --- OR ---
        keybase push           # to select from a menu

    If you need a public key, we'll happily generate one for you:

        keybase gen --push     # Generate a new key and push public part to server

    Enjoy!

I want to push my PGP public key. The same one I use for email. I'll try the menu-based approach:

    $ keybase push
    Multiple keys found, please pick one:
     (1)  4096R  3D214F8F5BC5ED73  exp: never  chris@beams.io
     (2)  4096R  1635DC602F5D4D55  exp: never  cbeams@gopivotal.com
    Pick a key: 1
    info: Picked key: 3D214F8F5BC5ED73

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Enabling cbeams@keybase.io
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    All keybase users get a free @keybase.io address, which
    forwards incoming mail and acts, for privacy, as the return
    address on outgoing mail generated via `keybase email`.

    This feature works **much** better with existing GPG clients
    if you add cbeams@keybase.io to your public key.

    You have 3 options:

      (1) Exit now; I can add cbeams@keybase.io with GPG or my own software
      (2) Allow keybase to add it for me
      (3) Skip this step and do it later (not recommended)

    Your choice (2):

Interesting. I've never actually added an additional email to a PGP public key, though I've wondered about doing it before. I'm curious. I think I'll choose option (2), but I'll bring up the GPG Keychain first so I can get a before and after picture (I literally took a bunch of screenshots).

    Your choice (2): 2

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    OK. Keybase will now modify your public key by merging
    cbeams@keybase.io into its approved list of emails.  This
    operation requires temporary local access to your secret
    key and then throws it away. The client will not write
    your decrypted secret key to disk or to the server.

    Passphrase for key 'Chris Beams <chris@beams.io>': ***************
    info: success!

Upon seeing success, I switched back to the GPG Keychain and was in for a shock:

![http://i.imgur.com/Ybjfw2e.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ybjfw2e.png)

Where did my chris@beams.io key go? After a bit of looking, I see that the new cbeams@keybase.io entry has been made "primary". I'm not sure if this is something Keybase has control over, but I certainly want to keep my own chris@beams.io address as the primary. Fortunately, this was just the click of a button in the GPG interface (the Primär button):

![http://i.imgur.com/lMket3f.png](http://i.imgur.com/lMket3f.png)

The command line tells me that keybase indeed has my information:

    $ keybase search cbeams
    -       cbeams  1e30313008a78c743f4e41973d214f8f5bc5ed73

... though there's not much there yet.

What's next? I suppose it's getting down to verifying all my identities. Should be fun. I check the docs once more to make sure they don't say otherwise. Nope. They don't give specific instructions to start proving identities, either.

I update my basic bio at https://keybase.io/cbeams.

So I start the proving process. Note that I'm doing Twitter last, so that when I do, if folks click on it, they'll see all the other identies, e.g. GitHub.

    $ keybase prove github cbeams

    You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
