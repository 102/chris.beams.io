_The bitcoin world moves pretty fast. Here are a few reasons I find keeping up with it worthwhile—and a few of the resources I use to do it._

Firstly, this post has nothing to do with keeping up with the _price_ of bitcoin. I do own bitcoin, and therefore care about its price in the long term, but am largely uninterested in its day-to-day movements. That stuff is a distraction.

When I talk about bitcoin in this context, I'm including not only bitcoin the currency, code, and network, but also the many related ideas and technologies that have preceded and followed from it. _Keeping up to date with bitcoin_, then, is a kind of shorthand for keeping up with an entire emerging field—one that not only includes cryptocurrency in all its forms, but also their consequences and higher-order effects over time.

When I look for news in the bitcoin world, I'm often looking for several things:

 1. **How is the public responding to this technology?** Who is succeeding in educating people about it, and how can we replicate and improve on those efforts?

 2. **How are governments reacting to this technology?** How are they trying to regulate, ban and besmirch it? Conversely, who among them are embracing it? What can we do to [route around](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Gilmore) the former and encourage the latter?

 3. **What's happening with the technology itself?** What new ideas are emerging to improve its functionality, usability, security and privacy? Which projects are the most promising and which among them need help?

I'm also always on the lookout for political and economic theory (old or new) that can help us understand how best to integrate this new technology into society.

In fact, the more I read and research these matters, the more I think that bitcoin won't be _integrated_ into society so much as it will actually _change_ it. This sort of statement sounds very grand, I know; but recall what's happened in our own lifetimes with the free and borderless exchange of information on the internet. Just imagine what will happen when money and other forms of value take on those same attributes at scale. 

In any case, we very much need theory and philosophy right now, to help make sense of ourselves in relation to these new and powerful tools, and to provide alternatives to modes of thought that no longer work or are no longer necessary in light of them. It's been one of the great intellectual adventures of my life to read the history of ideas in this domain, and often my first contact with those ideas occured in one of the forums listed below.

It's not all about changing the world, by the way. It's also entertaining as hell to watch this space. Scarcely a day goes by without news of villany or victory. There are many great minds at work here; it's inspiring and sometimes even intimidating to be around them. Those great minds sometimes also have great egos, and that means there are regular displays of fireworks, too—if you know where to find them.

What you'll find below, then, are the resources that I've found most effective and enjoyable in staying up to date with the larger world of bitcoin. It's by no means comprehensive or authoritative—just a few of my own personal preferences. I hope you find them useful, and would love to hear about any of your own favorites in the comments.

**ZeroBlock**. ZeroBlock is several things, including a trading platform, but here I am referring just to the [ZeroBlock mobile app](https://zeroblock.com/mobile/). Its news feed feature allows one to select from a large variety of bitcoin news sources (including several mentioned below) and to aggregate them in one convenient place. This app has become indispensable—if I had only one tool for keeping up with bitcoin, ZeroBlock would be it.

**r/bitcoin**. The [bitcoin subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin) is tremendously active, and almost always worth a browse. Yes, there's plenty of noise, but more than enough signal to be found. It's a great place to take the pulse of the community, and often to have a good laugh.

**Let's Talk Bitcoin**. It seems that [Let's Talk Bitcoin](http://letstalkbitcoin.com) (LTB) is on its way to becoming a mini-media empire. Authors and podcasters are incentivised to contribute content to the LTB network, and many do. The result is a steady stream of written content and an array of podcasts to choose from. I read and listen to a variety of these from time to time—and quality among them varies—but the original [Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/category/episodes) is what I am recommending here. For the most part, the interviews are not to be missed, and I often get value from the commentary and discussion among the show's three hosts.

**CoinDesk**. [CoinDesk](http://coindesk.com) is the go-to news site for many who watch bitcoin closely. These days it's not a destination that I check regularly, but I do often end up reading their articles when I find them trending on Reddit or otherwise showing up in my ZeroBlock feed. In general I appreciate their editorial values and hope they keep it up (sometimes industry-specific news sites just turn into trash over time; CoinDesk hasn't—at least not yet).

**IRC**. One of the great things about the bitcoin development community is that everyone's on IRC. Most major topics and projects have a dedicated channel at Freenode—[search the channel list for "bitcoin"](http://irc.netsplit.de/channels/?net=freenode&chat=bitcoin) to see what I mean. I'm typically lurking in [#bitcoinj, #bitcoin-dev, #bitcoin-wizards, and #bitsquare.io](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoinj,bitcoin-dev,bitcoin-wizards,bitsquare.io)—[`/msg cbeams`](http://www.livinginternet.com/r/ra_priv.htm) if you stop by!

> Note: the [#bitcoin](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin) room is very active, but not development-specific and a bit noisy for me. Do hang out there for a bit, though, if you're new to all this. It's a fine place to ask questions (so long as you've at least tried answering it for yourself via Google, etc).

**Bitcoin Magazine**. [Bitcoin Magazine](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/) is often a great resource (and is even available in [print form](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/magazine/product-category/print/)). If you're just ramping up, you'd do well to read through the archives of magazine co-founder [Vitalik Buterin's articles](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/author/vitalik-buterin/)—for example, his _Introduction to Bitcoin Terminology_, parts [I](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/270/introduction-to-bitcoin-terminology-part-i/) and [II](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/270/introduction-to-bitcoin-terminology-part-ii/).

**Meetups**. There are [bitcoin meetups](http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=bitcoin&radius=Infinity) in most major cities. I attend the one here in Vienna put on by [Bitcoin Austria](http://bitcoin-austria.at/), and have met a number of great people.

**Conferences**. There's a neverending stream of bitcoin conferences popping up around the world. The [events page](https://bitcoin.org/en/events) at bitcoin.org is a good place to see what's happening near you, and there's an [RSS feed](https://bitcoin.org/en/rss/events.rss) to keep up with new events as they're announced.

> Note: Different bitcoin conferences can cater to very different audiences—some are more tech-focused, some more academic, some oriented toward business. I've sometimes heard complaints from those who've attended a conference only to find that the content was too high-level or general for their interests.

**Blogs**. There is just an eclectic handful of bitcoin-related blogs in my feed reader: [Ethereum](https://blog.ethereum.org/), [Conformal Systems](https://blog.conformal.com/category/bitcoin/), the [Bitcoin Foundation](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/), and the blog of Bitcoin Core developer [Jeff Garzik](http://garzikrants.blogspot.co.at/). I'd love to see more blogging by economists studying bitcoin; [Economics of Bitcoin](http://www.economicsofbitcoin.com/) and [Cryptonomics](http://cryptonomics.org/) are out there, but infrequently updated of late. Recommendations welcome.

**Notable exceptions**. There are many resources I'm not mentioning, some of them quite important like the [Bitcointalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/) and [bitcoin-development mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/bitcoin-development/). While I've spent plenty of time reading these, I don't on a daily basis at the moment, simply because they can be high-volume, time-consuming and inbox-clogging.


### Beware the echo chamber
When spending time immersed in any topic, one runs the risk of falling prey to groupthink. In this regard, it's fortunate that the larger bitcoin community enjoys a robust diversity of opinion on just about everything. But it's still important to pay extra attention to those "outside the group" who think differently. I make it a point to read anything I come across that offers reasoned economic, political or technical criticisms of bitcoin and related technologies. Thus far, the failures of these counter-arguments to convince me has greatly bolstered my enthusiasm. Indeed, one of the things that makes bitcoin so fascinating is that for all its audacious ambition, there exist no knock-down arguments as to why it cannot or should not succeed.
