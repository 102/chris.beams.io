Thanks to:

 - [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/) and the [Jekyll maintainers](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/contributors) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is used to generate this site.

 - [Mark Otto](http://markdotto.com/) for the development of [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), the Jekyll theme on which this site's CSS was originally based (and [much of it](/css/style.css) still is).

 - [Benjamin Winterberg](http://winterbe.com) for permission to use his excellent [Darcula](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)-themed [syntax highlighting](http://winterbe.com/posts/2014/03/16/java-8-tutorial/) (which I have [modified](http://localhost:4000/css/darcula.css)).

 - [Aral Balkan](http://aralbalkan.com/), some elements of whose CSS I've ripped off (and modified).

 - And the countless others who, through their time and development of free and open source software have made the internet such a damned cool place to be. Let's keep it that way, shall we?
